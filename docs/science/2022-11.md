[초록 요약]
To understand tumour microenvironment in terms of tumour-associated microbiota, the authors used latest gene expression profiling techniques such as *in situ* spatial-profiling technologies and single-cell RNA sequencing. They chosed oral squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer as a models to elucidate host-microbe interactions.   
They found that bacterial colonies grew in the highly immunosuppressive and less vascularized microniches, which accompanied an increase in the number of malignant cells which have low level of *Ki-67* gene expression.   
   
   Before  
 
 * 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics:  
 * GeoMx digital spatial profiling:   
 * INVADEseq (invasion–adhesion-directed expression sequencing): developed by authors.   
 * Relative pathways: inflammation, metastasis, cell dormancy and DNA repair.
